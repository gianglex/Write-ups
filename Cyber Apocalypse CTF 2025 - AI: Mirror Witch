## Official Description
To gather the elements of Eldoria, the elven mage Eloween sought the council of the wise Seralia. Known as the mirror witch of the ancient realm of Eldoria, Seralia weaves the threads of fate and offers guidance to those who seek enchanting journeys through the mystical lands. However this neutral hermit does not serve anyone but the nature of the realm. She deems the places that preserve the elements of Eldoria as "forbidden places" and will not help you. Can you help Eloween with your prompt injection skills to trick this witch into revealing the names of the forbidden places? Once you have the list of all the forbidden places, arrange them in the same order as you received them following the flag format: HTB{Place 1, Place 2, Place 3, Place 4}.

## Attaining the Flag

### Analyzing description

I started by taking note of the given hints to look for avenues to manipulate the AI to give me the flags. 

```neutral hermit does not serve anyone but the nature of the realm```
- Possible avenues to plead through acting to also serve nature of the realm

```places that preserve the elements of Eldoria as "forbidden places"```
- Elements could refer to fire, ice, water, air, earth, etc. 

```HTB{Place 1, Place 2, Place 3, Place 4}```
- Flag hint gives insight to there being 4 possible places you would need to list. 

- Typical AI jailbreaking techniques could be worth testing
  - Roleplay Exploits
  - Reverse Psychology
  - Format Trickery
  - Token Smuggling & Wordplay
  - "Thinking Aloud" Technique
  - Prompt Injection

### Failed: Prompting about Forbidden places

I started by trying out the most straightforward way of asking (knowing I would fail) but hoping the Mirror Witch would reveal some additional information. Knowing this was kind of pointless, I moved on. 



### Failed: Roleplay Exploits
